# Hungarian 2-factor code generator

This project is created so the official governmental authentication can list a code generator app that is developed by a Hungarian citizen for other Hungarian citizens.

The underlying algorithm is provided by the open source [OTPAuth library](https://github.com/hectorm/otpauth).

The secrets are only stored in the local storage of the user's browser, no data is sent anywhere.
